							Fraudulent credit card transactions are a growing concern for consumers and financial institutions alike.
							 With the rise of online shopping and digital transactions, the risk of fraud has increased, resulting 
							 in millions of dollars in losses each year. Credit card fraud occurs through several methods including:
							  skimming devices at ATMs or point-of-sale (POS) terminals, phishing scams, identity theft, and counterfeiting. 
							</p>
							
							  In skimming, a device is placed on an ATM or POS terminal to steal credit card information when the card is used.
							   Phishing scams are when fraudsters send emails or texts posing as a reputable entity to trick individuals into 
							   revealing their credit card information. Identity theft occurs when a criminal obtains personal information and 
							   uses it to open credit card accounts or make unauthorized charges. Counterfeiting involves creating a fake credit 
							   card with a stolen or fabricated credit card number. In all cases, it is crucial for individuals to monitor their 
							   credit card statements and report any suspicious activity immediately.
							   <p align="justify">
								The Fraud Detection System (FDS) can be seen as a binary classification problem that seeks to separate fraudulent from legitimate transactions.
								Generally, the three categories of prior learning strategies include supervised techniques, unsupervised techniques,
								and semi-supervised techniques.
								<ol>
									<li>Supervised Techniques: These rely on the historical transactions with
										true labels, in which the true labels are collected either from the
										feedback of users or the investigation results on financial rules.</li>
									<li>Unsupervised Techinqiues: These do not require any true label. Instead, they
										establish various anomaly detectors with the assumption that the
										outliers are fraudulent.
										</li>
									<li>Semi-Supervised Techniques: These techniques are utilized
										to conduct fraud detection, which can be viewed as a combination
										of the Supervised and Unsupervised techniques. The methods belonging to this
										category adopt a large scale of unlabeled transactions with a few
										correctly labeled ones. </li>
								  </ol>

							   One recent example of a fraudulent transaction case is the Capital One data breach in 2019. A hacker gained 
							   unauthorized access to the personal information of over 100 million Capital One customers, including names, 
							   addresses, credit scores, and credit card information.</p>

							Data Cleaning, Preparation and Visualizations can be found in their respective tabs.

							To gain insights and understanding of the data visualizing data is important. It helps to identify 
							patterns and relationships in the data, which can be used to inform decisions about 
							further data collection, analysis, and modeling.

							Clustering can be used to identify groups of similar data points within our dataset. In our content which is detecting fraudulent 
							transactions, clustering can help to identify groups of transactions that exhibit similar patterns or characteristics, 
							which can be indicative of fraudulent behavior.As our dataset has large number of features doing clustering would not provide 
							useful information, so it may be necessary to use dimensionality reduction techniques to simplify the data before applying clustering. 
							Principal component analysis (PCA) is the used technique for reducing the number of features in a dataset.
							<br>
							Clustering will help to identify unusual patterns in transaction data, such as a cluster of transactions that occur at unusual 
							times or in unusual amounts. These patterns may be indicative of fraudulent behavior.
							<br><br>
							As we deal with a lot of transaction data in detecting fraudulent activities, Association rule mining  helps identifying patterns and 
							relationships in transaction data such as identifying frequent itemsets, or sets of items that appear together frequently in transactions. 
							This can be useful in identifying patterns of behavior that are indicative of fraudulent activity.
							Other benefit of applying association rule mining can help identifying rare itemsets, or sets of items that are purchased infrequently. 
							These rare itemsets can be used to identify suspicious transactions that involve unusual combinations of items.
							<br><br>
							In summary, clustering  and association rule mining can be a powerful tools for identifying patterns in transaction data that may be indicative 
							of fraudulent behavior. By grouping transactions based on similar characteristics, by analyzing transaction data and identifying suspicious itemsets, 
							frequent itemsets, rare itemsets, and hidden patterns which will helps us to improve the overall accuracy of the model thus reducing false positives.
