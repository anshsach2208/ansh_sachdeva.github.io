							Fraudulent credit card transactions are a growing concern for consumers and financial institutions alike.
							 With the rise of online shopping and digital transactions, the risk of fraud has increased, resulting 
							 in millions of dollars in losses each year. Credit card fraud occurs through several methods including:
							  skimming devices at ATMs or point-of-sale (POS) terminals, phishing scams, identity theft, and counterfeiting. 
							</p>
							
							  In skimming, a device is placed on an ATM or POS terminal to steal credit card information when the card is used.
							   Phishing scams are when fraudsters send emails or texts posing as a reputable entity to trick individuals into 
							   revealing their credit card information. Identity theft occurs when a criminal obtains personal information and 
							   uses it to open credit card accounts or make unauthorized charges. Counterfeiting involves creating a fake credit 
							   card with a stolen or fabricated credit card number. In all cases, it is crucial for individuals to monitor their 
							   credit card statements and report any suspicious activity immediately.
							   <p align="justify">
								The Fraud Detection System (FDS) can be seen as a binary classification problem that seeks to separate fraudulent from legitimate transactions.
								Generally, the three categories of prior learning strategies include supervised techniques, unsupervised techniques,
								and semi-supervised techniques.
								<ol>
									<li>Supervised Techniques: These rely on the historical transactions with
										true labels, in which the true labels are collected either from the
										feedback of users or the investigation results on financial rules.</li>
									<li>Unsupervised Techinqiues: These do not require any true label. Instead, they
										establish various anomaly detectors with the assumption that the
										outliers are fraudulent.
										</li>
									<li>Semi-Supervised Techniques: These techniques are utilized
										to conduct fraud detection, which can be viewed as a combination
										of the Supervised and Unsupervised techniques. The methods belonging to this
										category adopt a large scale of unlabeled transactions with a few
										correctly labeled ones. </li>
								  </ol>

							   One recent example of a fraudulent transaction case is the Capital One data breach in 2019. A hacker gained 
							   unauthorized access to the personal information of over 100 million Capital One customers, including names, 
							   addresses, credit scores, and credit card information.</p>

							Data Cleaning, Preparation and Visualizations can be found in their respective tabs.

							To gain insights and understanding of the data visualizing data is important. It helps to identify 
							patterns and relationships in the data, which can be used to inform decisions about 
							further data collection, analysis, and modeling.

							Clustering can be used to identify groups of similar data points within our dataset. In our content which is detecting fraudulent 
							transactions, clustering can help to identify groups of transactions that exhibit similar patterns or characteristics, 
							which can be indicative of fraudulent behavior.As our dataset has large number of features doing clustering would not provide 
							useful information, so it may be necessary to use dimensionality reduction techniques to simplify the data before applying clustering. 
							Principal component analysis (PCA) is the used technique for reducing the number of features in a dataset.
							<br>
							Clustering will help to identify unusual patterns in transaction data, such as a cluster of transactions that occur at unusual 
							times or in unusual amounts. These patterns may be indicative of fraudulent behavior.
							<br><br>
							As we deal with a lot of transaction data in detecting fraudulent activities, Association rule mining  helps identifying patterns and 
							relationships in transaction data such as identifying frequent itemsets, or sets of items that appear together frequently in transactions. 
							This can be useful in identifying patterns of behavior that are indicative of fraudulent activity.
							Other benefit of applying association rule mining can help identifying rare itemsets, or sets of items that are purchased infrequently. 
							These rare itemsets can be used to identify suspicious transactions that involve unusual combinations of items.
							<br><br>
							In summary, clustering  and association rule mining can be a powerful tools for identifying patterns in transaction data that may be indicative 
							of fraudulent behavior. By grouping transactions based on similar characteristics, by analyzing transaction data and identifying suspicious itemsets, 
							frequent itemsets, rare itemsets, and hidden patterns which will helps us to improve the overall accuracy of the model thus reducing false positives.

							As there might be repercussions if a fraudulent transaction is missed, detecting them can be a difficult and dangerous undertaking.
							A fraudulent transaction that goes unnoticed can cause substantial financial losses, reputational harm, and even legal repercussions. On the other hand, 
							incorrectly identifying a valid transaction as fraudulent may lead to customer annoyance, lost sales, and harm to the customer relationship.
							<br>
							Fraudulent transactions can harm the financial institution's reputation and result in a decline in client loyalty and trust. Also, to safeguard consumers, 
							regulatory authorities mandate that financial institutions have effective fraud detection systems. It is crucial for financial institutions to have strong 
							fraud detection systems in place since the growing use of technology in financial transactions has made it simpler for fraudsters to carry out sophisticated 
							fraudulent operations.

							The goal of model selection is to choose the model that will produce the best predictions on future data. The model with the highest expected fraud detection 
							performances on the following block of transactions is the optimal model for a fraud detection system.
							Use of imbalanced learning techniques in the context of credit card fraud detection. A wide range of approaches were considered here, 
							resampling, and ensemble techniques.
							Imbalanced learning techniques allowed to provide slight improvements in terms of AUC ROC or training times for balanced bagging and balanced random forest, 
							as we saw from our model exploration random forest did performed the best
						</p>
						<p align="justify">
							Cost-sensitive and resampling strategies can be used to widely classify unbalanced learning systems. Algorithms are modified in cost-sensitive approaches to 
							favor the detection of the minority class. This typically calls for changing the optimization function during the learning algorithm's training phase. 
							Rebalancing the dataset before the training technique is applied is how resampling approaches, on the other hand, work at the data level. Resampling can be done 
							by omitting samples from the majority class, including examples from the minority class, or using a combination of undersampling and oversampling strategies.

						<h2>Q&A</h2>
						<h4>How many fraudulent transactions have been detected on a city level?</h4>
							<p>Here from the graph transactions that are ONLINE has the most number of frauds and it can be said
								that most of the frauds happens during ONLINE transactions.
							</p>
						
							<h4>Explain the variations among the amount of Fraud and Non-Fraud Transactions over the years</h4>
							<p>The graphs depics that there has been year-over-year growth in the amount of transactions, but also
								we see that the fraudulent transactions are not so huge numbers. Which means most of the fraudulent
								transactions are very low amount.
							</p>
						
							<h4>During which hour of the day is the fraudulent transactions more active?</h4>
							<p>The graph shows the average fraudulent transaction amounts during the hour from which we can infer that during midnight
								and afternoon fraudulent transactions are more active.
							</p>
			
							<h4>How much transaction amounts are recorded by individual cities? (Top 10) </h4>
							<p>From the graph it is evident that Houston has the biggest transaction amounts totalled, close to $45k and on second is Miami
								with almost $31k and on third is Atlanta very close to Miami with $27k.
							</p>
						
							<h4>How much transaction amounts are recorded by individual states? (Top 10) </h4>
							<p>From the graph it is evident that California has the biggest transaction amounts totalled, close to $450k and on second is Texas
								with almost $300k and on third is New York  with $270k.</p>
						
							<h4>Is there any relationship with number of users and transactions amount?</h4>
							<p>Over the years the number of distinct users and total amount is increasing that tells that there is increase
								in year over year card users and expenditure. </p>
						
							<h4>Which are the different modes of transactions used?</h4>
							<p>From the pie chart,over 63% of the people have used Swipe Transaction while paying the amount
								which tell us that it is the most used mode of transaction for a credit card.
							</p>
						
							<h4>Is time normally distributed and if not what is the underlying distribution?</h4>
							<p>From the graph, the distribution is not normally ditributed and looks like a Bimodal Distribution
								suggesting two variety of groups in time data.
							</p>
					
							<h4>Explain the trend of frauds cases over the years? Is it increasing?decreasing?</h4>
							<p>The graph depicts that during 2010 there were almost 20 fraudulent transaction reported which is maximum among the rest
								and 16 during the year 2007. The reported cases doesn't follow a pattern rathern than have a resonating kind of nature.
